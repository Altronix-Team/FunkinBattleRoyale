[**IF YOU WANT TO HOST A SERVER, READ THIS**](server/README.md)

To connect to a server, type the ip of the server, the port and password as **provided by the server host**.

**You can find games to join** in the [FNF Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/YYb3wzud3j).

# Common errors

### Socket error: Connection failed

This means that the game couldn't find the server you typed in. This probably means that the server is disconnected, or you typed the ip or port wrong. It could also happen due to a lack of an internet connection.

### Failed to verify server. Make sure the server and client are up to date

This means the server and game versions are incompatible. Update the version of your game or contact the host to update the version of the server.

### Wrong password

The password you entered is wrong. Contact the host to get the correct password.

### Game already in progress

This means the game you are trying to join has already started, and you'll have to wait for the current round to end before joining.

### Game is already full

This means the server has reached it's player maximum, so you aren't allowed to enter.
